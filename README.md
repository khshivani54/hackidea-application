# hackidea-application
I am developing an application where employess can enter to application by entering employee id and then they will have option to sort already added hack idea by vote counts and creation date. And employees will be able to add new idea after clicking on new idea tab users will get three options: title, description, tags (tags would be pre-defined tags).
